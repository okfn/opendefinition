# Summary

Had some trouble with the hangout so had to create a new one as it seems the existing one wasn’t re-usable after all.  Will try this as calendar invitation in the future as well as the usual notice.

### Discussion of OD 2.0


ACTION: Herb will push ahead and get us to 2.0 draft in as close to it’s final form and we will pick up the discussion from there.  This will include taking out the comments as our goal is to make the points as clear as possible without the commentary.  ( perhaps a separate “guide” document for reviewers would be useful instead of the comments and links that are in OD 2.0 draft right now.


### Japanese Translation

Discussion about translations in general, consider a process for translations in general.
ACTION: Herb to examine to existing “how you can help” text on OD web site and see if it needs more content about translation.

ACTION: Mike to put Japanese translation into github

ACTION: ? to notify Chiaki of the location of the Japanese translation

ACTION: Chiaki will fork the translation, make the changes and then make a pull request.

Suggestion from Chiaki: English could be the official version and other translations could refer to the English as the official version and translations are for convenience.

### OK Fest

Agreement that this might be a good venue to finalize the OD 2.0 discussion if it’s not already accomplished by then.
