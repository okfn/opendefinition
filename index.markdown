The **[Open Definition](/od/{{site.od_current_version}}/en/)** sets out principles that define "openness" in relation to **data and content**.

It makes **precise** the meaning of "open" in the terms **"open data"** and **"open content"** and thereby ensures **quality** and encourages **compatibility** between different pools of open material.

It can be summed up in the statement that:

> "Open means **anyone** can **freely access, use, modify, and share** for **any purpose** (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and openness)."

Put most succinctly:

> "Open data and content can be **freely used, modified, and shared** by **anyone** for **any purpose**"
