Version 2.1 dev

The Open Definition makes precise the meaning of "open" with respect to knowledge, promoting a robust commons in which anyone may participate, and interoperability is maximized.

**Summary:** *Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it â€” subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.*

This essential meaning matches that of "open" with respect to software as in the [Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) and is synonymous with "free" or "libre" as in the [Free Software Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition) and [Definition of Free Cultural Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works).

The term **work** will be used to denote the item or piece of knowledge being transferred.

The term **license** refers to the legal conditions under which the work is
provided. Where no license has been offered the term refers to default legal conditions
governing use of the work (for example, copyright or public domain).

## 1. Open Works

An open **work** *must* satisfy the following requirements in its distribution:

### 1.1 Open License

The **work** *must* be provided under an open **license** (as defined in Section 2).
Any additional terms accompanying the work (such as a terms of use, or patents held by the licensor) *must not* 
contradict the terms of the license.

### 1.2 Access

The **work** *must* be provided as a whole and at no more than a reasonable 
one-time reproduction cost, and *should* be downloadable via the Internet without charge.
Any additional information necessary for license compliance (such as names of 
contributors required for compliance with attribution requirements) *must* also 
accompany the work.

### 1.3 Open Format

The **work** *must* be provided in an open format. An open format is
one which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use and can be fully processed
with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool. The work *should* be provided in the form preferred for making modifications to it.

## 2. Open Licenses

A **license** is open if its terms satisfy the following conditions:

### 2.1 Required Permissions

The **license** *must* irrevocably permit (or allow) the following:

#### 2.1.1 Use

The **license** *must* allow free use of the licensed work.

The **license** *must* allow redistribution of the licensed work, 
including sale, whether on its own or as part of a collection made from 
works from different sources.

#### 2.1.3 Modification

The **license** *must* allow the creation of derivatives of the licensed 
work and allow the distribution of such derivatives under the same
terms of the original licensed work.

#### 2.1.4 Separation

The **license** *must* allow any part of the work
to be freely used, distributed, or modified separately from any other part 
of the work or from any collection of works in which it was originally 
distributed. All parties who receive any distribution of any part of
a work within the terms of the original license *should* have the same rights
as those that are granted in conjunction with the original work.

#### 2.1.5 Compilation

The **license** *must* allow the licensed work to be distributed along 
with other distinct works without placing restrictions on these other works.

#### 2.1.6 Non-discrimination

The **license** *must not* discriminate against any person or group.

The rights attached to the work *must* apply to all to whom it is redistributed 
without the need to agree to any additional legal terms.

#### 2.1.8 Application to Any Purpose

The **license** *must* allow use, redistribution, modification, and 
compilation for any purpose. The license *must not* restrict anyone
from making use of the work in a specific field of endeavor.

#### 2.1.9 No Charge

The **license** *must not* impose any fee arrangement, royalty, or other
compensation or monetary remuneration as part of its conditions.

### 2.2 Acceptable Conditions

The **license** must not limit, make uncertain, or otherwise diminish the permissions 
required in Section 2.1 except by the following allowable conditions:

#### 2.2.1 Attribution

The **license** *may* require distributions of the work to include attribution
of contributors, rights holders, sponsors, and creators as long as
any such prescriptions are not onerous.

#### 2.2.2 Integrity

The **license** *may* require that modified versions of a licensed work
carry a different name or version number from the original work or 
otherwise indicate what changes have been made. 

#### 2.2.3 Share-alike

#### 2.2.7 Technical Restriction Prohibition

The **license** *may* require that distributions of the work remain free of any technical measures that would restrict the exercise of otherwise allowed rights.

#### 2.2.8 Non-aggression

The **license** *may* require modifiers to grant the public additional permissions (for example, patent licenses) as required for exercise of the rights allowed by the license. The license may also condition permissions on not aggressing against licensees with respect to exercising any allowed right (again, for example, patent litigation).
